# ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Classifier

This project demonstrates how to use the **Decision Tree Classifier** â€” a simple yet powerful algorithm â€” to build a supervised machine learning model for classification tasks.

## ðŸ§  What is a Decision Tree?

A **Decision Tree** is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used for **classification** and **regression**. It works like a flowchart where:
- Each **node** represents a feature,
- Each **branch** represents a decision,
- Each **leaf** represents the final output (class label).

## ðŸš€ Project Steps

1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Preprocess the data (if needed)  
3. Split the data into training and testing sets  
4. Train the Decision Tree model using `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn  
5. Make predictions on test data  
6. Measure model accuracy  
7. Visualize the decision tree
